# FIT - Fabians Investment Tool

## Why FIT

### My financial future

When thinking about my long term financial future, it became more and more obvious that simply putting money into a savings account was a suboptimal strategy to achieve my financial goals.

Low interest rates combined with bad protection against inflation did not outweigh the advantages of safety, liquidity and protection from loss - at least not after a certain threshold.

Hence I started looking for alternatives.

I discovered the concept of value investing. From what I learned so far, it may be a strategy that suits me.

### Assessing a companies value

One of the core problems is assessing the value of a companies traded on the stock market.

The value can the be compared with the price, which is comparatively easy to calculate.

Nowadays, there is a ton of information available about most publicly traded companies.

Digging through the flood of information and filtering out relevant characteristics and values appears to be an important skill.

### Software assistance

It felt natural to use my software development skills to give it a shot.

The main objective of this tool is to gather, compare and visualize data of companies so that reasonable conclusions can be drawn.

### Secondary objective

As a secondary objective, I also intend to learn new technologies and expand my skills with respect to designing, implementing and deploying web applications.
